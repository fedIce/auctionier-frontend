        "content": "Items that are rare, unique, collectible, or of high quality are best suited for auction. These can include fine art, jewelry, antiques, classic cars, luxury watches, designer furniture, rare comics, and other specialist collectibles. Everyday, mass-produced, or low-value items generally are not accepted as they do not attract enough interest from bidders."

        "title": "2. How do I ensure my items are accepted?",
        "content": "To maximize the chances of your item being accepted, ensure that it fits within our approved categories and meets standards of authenticity, quality, and rarity. Always provide clear, accurate descriptions and multiple high-quality photographs. Avoid submitting items in poor condition, replicas, or incomplete sets. The more information you provide about the item’s background and authenticity, the higher the likelihood of acceptance."

        "content": "Your item presentation should be as professional as possible. Use a descriptive title that highlights the key features, such as the brand, year, or unique qualities. Write a detailed description that includes size, material, condition, provenance, and any special features. Upload sharp, well-lit photos from different angles, and if possible, include close-ups of hallmarks, maker’s marks, or any relevant details that can assure authenticity."

        "title": "4. What makes an item attractive to bidders?",
        "content": "Bidders are particularly drawn to items that are authentic, well-documented, and in excellent condition. Certificates of authenticity, original packaging, or provenance documentation significantly increase trust and desirability. Rarity also plays a big role—items that are hard to find or limited in production usually attract more competitive bidding. Clear, professional photographs and a well-written description make your listing stand out among others."

These include counterfeit or imitation goods, items that are damaged or incomplete, items with unclear ownership or illegal provenance, and mass-produced low-value products that do not meet collector standards. Always review the prohibited items list before submitting your item to avoid rejection."
